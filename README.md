# safetystop
This project is a smart traffic stop assistant designed to reduce escalation in the first 7 seconds of police stops. It uses an Arduino Uno R3, ESP32-CAM, fingerprint sensor, speaker, and Wi-Fi communication to securely transmit a driver’s license, registration, and identity verification directly to a police officer’s laptop.
